<h2>Alone in the Unknown</h2>
<div class="content">
  <p>In the quit of this strange place
     Where shawdows dance upon my face
     Lie's marathon unfolds at a snails pace
     No Trust, No refuge, No safe space
  
  
     Zero, nada, echoes in the void
     Where is our Heru, our savior deployed?
     Bound by sins, no path to escape
     Chasing victories, a relentless chase
  
     I long to lift my mother from earths embrace
     This life, a frantic race, a relentless race
     "NO, NO, NO," I cry, defiance in my tone
     How can my oppressor grant true education
  
     But listen closely, for power awaits
     When i ascend, I'll reclaim my fate
     Unseat the tyrant from his lofty throne
     And cast him down, his bones overthrown
   
     For he fed me lies through countless years
     Yet now i hunger for truth
     undying and clear</p>
